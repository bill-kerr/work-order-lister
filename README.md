### Work Order Lister
The Work Order Lister program is intended to be run inside a directory whose subdirectories are named beginning with the "GR4_" prefix.
The program will scan these folders for a .txt file and add both the name of the directory and the contents of the .txt file to a file named "work_orders.txt" in the parent directory.
The "work_orders.txt" file will list all work orders and their descriptions for easy viewing.
